# Problem
When it comes to grocery POS machines are used in counters to scan items a consumer bought and list it all showing the total amount to be paid. One problem that is caused by this is when a consumer buys many products every single one must be scanned in the counter consuming time resulting in a long pending que of consumers.
# Solution
Instead of Manually Scanning the items and picking it manually they could just order it from the webapp. By ordering the products they want they could just add them to the virtual cart, then pay for it online or generate a qr that would be scanned later for cash payments. After paying it they will have consumer id as a primary key and in receiving the order they can see if their order is ready or not based on the displayed consumer id on the screen. When the consumer id is displayed then they could just pick up the order. When implementing this system, we will put a specific area in the grocery store in which they could stand by there while they are ordering products in the web app
